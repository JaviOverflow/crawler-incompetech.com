    "description": "A low hum sets a dark and mysterious mood, but at 0:49 the orchestral strings, horns, and pounding drums begin, perfect as the background to the hero?s dilemma or impending battle scene. At 2:01 the music reaches a climax and builds into discordant, terrifying suspense. The ending, at 2:35, features a lone guitar and mournful vocals, depicting a great sadness and loss."

    "description": "My work has been seminal in the development of 'structuredly-non-linear symmetrical-music', a highly intellectual, and rather repetitive genre. My newest piece studies, experiences and isomorphically dominates a variety of structured tension-hemiolas. In short, the method must never present the sound-world. I never examine continuities, despite the fact that any gesture or non-linearity can be, and has been interpreted as a rather orchestrally-monophonic set of 'canon-aerophones'. In my most recent work, vibrations, materials and rhythmic oscillations are all used within chaotically-transdisciplinary gestures, allowing the audience to improvise a variety of symbolic idioms. I am very much influenced by the idea of dismissing popular solos, particularly whilst combined with a highly polyrhythmic approach to spaces. Download comes in one faster and one slower tempo.

It is very easy to record (Pizzicato strings have been one of the few samples that have sounded \"real\" for a long time).    3. The composer is long dead and his stuff is in the Public Domain (L�o Delibes; 1891). And for some background... Sylvia is a 3-Act ballet first produced in 1876. I'm pretty certain this particular piece has nothing to do with the plot - or it wouldn't be called a \"divertissement\"."

    "description": "Beautiful dreamy piece that confuses times and spaces. You really just need to take a moment and listen to this one - because it is really cool. How cool? You should probably find out! There are a lot of extra synth things going on in it that are hidden in and amongst the piano, like one of those hidden picture books with 45 paperclips, but you can only ever see 7 of them. You can download this in uncompressed format here. Download comes with individual tracks so you can make your own mixes."

The orchestral sounds blend with the sharpness of the brass throughout, but especially after 0:36, when the music is lyrical and melodic, though intensely emotional and suspenseful. At 0:52, the rhythmic march begins again, with the strings playing the melody and the brass reaching discordant, swelling heights until the final crescendo at 1:10.

With the even rhythm and the sharply accentuated plucks of the koto, this is best used as an introduction to a short film or game, or the resolution to a conflict surrounding family or challenges to tradition."

This is music of wonder, and is best as exposition music for a film about nature or a group of people struggling to survive."

The bass drums are barely perceptible, but accentuate the orchestra as the three melodic personalities float amongst the music. The music is full of wonder and power, and ends in a strong chord, evoking a connection with nature."

At 1:04 the percussion is tacit, and at 1:18 a rippling crescendo builds to long, demented pulls on the string bass. The percussive beat begins again at 2:18, and then the frenzied, reverbed staccato of the piano enters, accompanied by a swelling synth lead. At 3:40 the piece finds it?s stride with pulsating synthesizer effects and a rumbling bass line. Best used as accompaniment for a tense, difficult level of a game or as the final battle with a villain. Because of its steady bass beat and snyth effects, this could also work well to depict a tense and suspenseful race to the finish, or as the music playing during a vibrant, pounding rave. "

You did the same thing when I lent you \"Smokey and the Bandit II\", and I didn't say anything because you had a hard week, but still managed to make the Jell-o Salad with the grapes for the family reunion... which was nice. Anyway, I'll probably just get you one of those $20 tape rewinders they have at Radio Shack for your birthday. I also enrolled you in the Battery of the Month Club. You're welcome."

I'm sure it was a nice car. I've never owned one. But there were a lot of them! The late 70's Thunderbirds are particularly horrifying... They had those headlight covers that flipped up... because that was a good idea at some point. But this piece! Oh! This piece! Atmosphere like you wouldn't believe! The flute is just so earthy! The organic drones are also beautiful. The whole thing is beautiful. Kind of like you went to an alien day spa in another dimension where days last for years, but you still never get all wrinkly when you're in the bubbly warm waters. mmmm... bubbly warm waters... with the slight possibility of a serial killer.
